{{--
    The row's action cell — compiled once for the table, filled per row.

    Variables: $cellPadding, $borderClass, $stickyCellClass and $stickyLayers
    (all table-level, baked at compile time) and $actions (a slot: this row's
    buttons, already rendered).

    The layers and the `relative` on the button row are what a pinned actions
    column needs and an ordinary one does not notice: with `stickyActions()` off
    both strings are empty and this is the same cell it always was. Why a pinned
    cell takes three layers rather than an opaque background: Support\StickyColumn.

    It lived inline in the row loop until the loop's conditionals moved into PHP.
    The buttons themselves stay per record — an action can be non-executable for
    one row and not the next — which is why they carry `wire:key="act-…"` now:
    that is what pairs them through a morph, in place of the `@foreach` markers
    this partial no longer emits.

    Mind the whitespace: the tags touch on purpose. A run of whitespace between
    two tags is a DOM text node that the morph walks on every commit, and this
    cell is emitted once per row. Whitespace between attributes is free.
