{{-- Excel-style fill handle.
     Variables: $fillColumns (array<int, string>), $fillMax (int)

     ONE handle per table, not one per cell. Two reasons, and both are binding:
     a per-cell handle would be columns×rows elements of record-invariant markup
     (the render-cost model forbids exactly that), and it would have to live
     inside the editable cell partial — which TextInputColumn renders once into a
     skeleton and splices three per-record tokens into, so any fourth per-record
     thing there silently freezes at the first row.

     wireFillHandle positions this element over whichever editable cell is active
     and moves it as the selection changes. It stays inert without JS. --}}
