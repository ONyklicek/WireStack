{{--
    The selection cell — rendered ONCE per table, not once per row.

    Every part of this markup is table-static: the padding, the range-selection
    modifier prefix, both class lists, and the check icon. The only per-record value
    is the record key, which arrives as $keyJs — a Skeleton slot at compile time, the
    record's own `Js::from()` key at fill time. It appears four times under one
    encoding (inside an Alpine expression), so it is one slot.

    See Table::getSelectionCellSkeleton(); this partial stays the single source of
    the markup and the vendor:publish override point, exactly as it was — it is the
    RENDER that moved out of the row loop, not the template.

    Mind the whitespace: the tags below deliberately touch. A run of whitespace
    between two tags is one DOM text node, and the morph walks every one of them on
    every commit — this cell alone used to lay out ten of them per row. Whitespace
    BETWEEN attributes is free (no node), so the attributes stay laid out.
--}}
{{-- The whole cell toggles, not just the 16px box, which is under every touch-target
     guideline while the rest of the cell sits dead. While ranges are on, a modified
     click is left alone: Shift and mod mean range and add-to-selection, and the row
     controller answers those for the whole row, cell included. With ranges off nobody
     else would answer them, so the cell takes every click and toggles.

     data-select-cell marks the selection column for the sweep gesture (and the widened
     click target): the cell is found by this hook, never by column position — sortable
     prepends a drag-handle <td> and would shift every index. --}}
