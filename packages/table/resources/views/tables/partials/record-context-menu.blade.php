{{--
    The row's right-click menu panel — rendered ONCE per table, not once per row.

    The panel carries no per-row Alpine state: the single wireRecordActions controller
    on the <tbody> opens, positions and closes it by record key (data-record-menu). So
    the only things that vary per row are that key and the item markup, and they arrive
    as slots — $key inside an attribute, $menu as already-rendered markup.

    <template> is a script-supporting element, valid as a direct child of <tr>.

    See Table::getRowContextMenuSkeleton(). As everywhere in the row loop, the tags
    below deliberately touch: a run of whitespace between two tags is one DOM text node
    that the morph walks on every commit. Whitespace between attributes is free.
