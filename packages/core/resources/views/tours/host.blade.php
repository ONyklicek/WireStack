{{-- The guided walkthrough, mounted once per page by whatever draws the chrome.

     Registered into NyonCode\WireCore\Foundation\View\PageChrome by this
     package's service provider. An application that has registered no tour
     renders nothing here at all — see the `@if` below, which is where that is
     decided, and why it is decided there rather than at boot.

     ## No JavaScript ships for this

     Everything below is plain Alpine over data PHP resolved. The two things a
     tour popup is really made of are already on every page inside
     `wire-core-dropdown.js`, which is a declared bundle:

       $float(reference, floating, config)  — Floating UI with flip/shift/size,
                                              a z-index resolver that clears
                                              modals, and re-assertion after a
                                              Livewire morph strips inline style

       modals.partials.focus-trap           — expression-only, no bundle at all

     So this feature adds no entry to `build:core-assets`, no committed dist
     file and no bytes to any <head>.

     ## What it will not do

     **Below the sheet breakpoint the panel docks to the bottom of the screen**
     instead of floating beside its element. It used not to run there at all —
     the objection was that a sheet cannot point at anything — and that is
     answered rather than ignored: the highlight ring stays on the element and
     the page scrolls it into the room above the panel, so a phone gets a tour
     that points, not a stack of captions. An element a phone does not show (the
     sidebar is a drawer there) is skipped by the rule below, and the counter
     says the tour got shorter.

     **Every step scrolls its element into view**, on any screen: an element
     under the fold used to be pointed at from off-screen.

     **A step may be on another page** (`TourStep::on()`). Reaching it navigates
     there with the tour's id and the step in the query, the server renders the
     host for that page, and the tour carries on. The browser never knows a
     route — each step arrives with its page's URL, from the one owner of those.

     **A step whose element is missing or hidden is skipped, never fatal.** An
     application may have hidden a control, this screen may legitimately not
     have it, or it may be rendered and waiting behind an `x-show`. The
     worst outcome of an upgrade is therefore a tour that got shorter. That is
     also why a step names an element *hook* and not a selector: a typo would
     otherwise be indistinguishable from an absent element, which is why
     TourStep validates the name at definition time instead.

     ## Traps this file is written around

     - `$refs` are NOT populated when a parent's `x-init` runs, and the throw
       takes the whole region with it. Every first read of `$refs.panel` is
       inside `$nextTick`.
     - Single quotes throughout the Alpine expressions: a double quote inside an
       attribute truncates it, and this file would stop working silently.
     - Blade directives sit on their own lines inside an opening tag. A
       directive butted against a word character does not compile. --}}
{{-- Nothing to run is the overwhelmingly common answer — no tour registered, or
     none that claims this screen, or one this person already acknowledged — and
     it costs an empty `foreach` over the registry and this `@if`. The chrome
     itself is registered unconditionally, because provider order is composer's
     discovery order and an application registering its tours in its own
     provider may boot after this package. --}}
