{{-- Notification bell: the mark, and a slide-over panel behind it.

     A panel rather than a 320px dropdown, and that is the whole change: an inbox
     is a place you go, not a menu you brush past. It has room for the message
     under its title, for day headings, for a tab that hides what has been read,
     and for a link to the full list when one is routed — none of which fits a
     dropdown that has to stay narrow enough not to cover the page it hangs off.

     ─── The mark has three states, not two ───────────────────────

     A bell with no badge cannot say whether nothing has ever happened or whether
     the user has read everything, and those are different things to be told:

       nothing at all   → a plain bell
       all read         → a quiet grey dot: something is in there, nothing is waiting
       unread           → the count, and it is the only thing here that is loud

     The count sits in a ring the colour of the surface behind it, so it reads as
     a chip attached to the bell rather than a blob overlapping it — which is
     what "subtle" buys you at this size: the shape is legible at 16px because
     the ring separates it, not because the colour shouts. --}}

                 `red`, not `danger`. `HasColor` already decided that danger MEANS
                 red and keeps its class strings literal so Tailwind's scanner
                 sees them; `bg-danger-500` in a template invents a token no
                 application defines, and an undefined utility is not a class —
                 the badge came out transparent with white text on white. Visible
                 in the markup, invisible on the screen, and nothing reports it.
                 `primary` is the one name deliberately left to the application
                 to define, and the installer writes that one. --}}
