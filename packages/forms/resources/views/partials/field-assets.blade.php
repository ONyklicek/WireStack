{{-- The wire-forms field controllers (date/time pickers, tags, rating, the rich
     and markdown editors), registered as Alpine.data() factories.

     Every field whose body moved out of its `x-data` includes this, because
     `@wireStackScripts` is additive rather than required: an app that never adds
     the directive to its layout still has to get the controller, or its
     `x-data="wireDateTimePicker(…)"` evaluates against an empty registry and the
     field silently does nothing. That is the same contract every other
     per-surface asset partial keeps (architecture/assets.md § The directive), and
     it is what the workbench previews run on.

     `@assets` rather than `@push`: no package layout renders a matching
     `@stack('scripts')`, and a DOM-morphed <script> inside a Livewire-loaded
     modal never executes. Livewire dedupes it per request, so including it from
     six field views costs one tag — and the bundle's own `registered` guard makes
     a second execution a no-op where the layout emits it too. --}}
