    | The Frame
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Which layout the signed-out screens render inside. They ship no frame of
    | their own, deliberately: a login page that does not look like the panel it
    | leads into is the one screen where a mismatch is noticed, and the shell
    | already owns a frame for exactly this — `wire-admin::auth-layout`, the head
    | and the card with none of the navigation.
    |
    | `auto` uses the shell's frame when the shell is installed. An application
    | with a frame of its own names it here instead:
    |
    |     'layout' => 'components.layouts.guest',
    |
    | With neither — no shell, no name — rendering a screen raises an exception
    | that says this, rather than a missing-component error one layer down.

    | The Screens

    | — it ships the routes, the credential check, the throttling, the reset
    | tokens and the two-factor challenge, and asks the application for the
    | markup — so this is the whole of what the package does on the way in.
    |
    | Which screens exist is Fortify's question, not this one: registration,
    | password reset, email verification and two-factor are its `features`, and
    | a screen for a feature that is off is never routed to. Turn this off to
    | keep the package for its user-menu entry alone, or while migrating from
    | views you already had.
    |
    | An application that wants six of the seven registers its own in a provider
    | of its own — application providers boot after package ones, so the last
    | `Fortify::loginView()` wins and it is yours.

    | On by default because the alternative was every application hand-writing
    | the same form into a layout slot: an admin whose menu has no way out reads
    | as unfinished, and it is not a decision anyone was making deliberately.

    | One-Time Codes

    |
    | Four things a six-digit code mailed to somebody can stand in for, and each
    | one is its own switch because each one is a different decision about the
    | same trade: a code is only as strong as the inbox it lands in (ADR 0037).
    |
    |   login           sign in with a code and no password at all. A user with
    |                   an authenticator app is still challenged for it — a code
    |                   to an inbox must not be the way around a second factor.
    |   second_factor   a code after a correct password, for people who have no
    |                   authenticator app. **Needs Fortify's two-factor feature
    |                   to be on**: the pipe that sends the code is the contract
    |                   Fortify only puts in its login pipeline when it is, and
    |                   with the feature off no code is ever sent. `php artisan
    |                   about` reports that state rather than printing "off".
    |   verify_email    confirm an address by typing a code. The signed link
    |                   Fortify mails keeps working beside it.
    |   reset_password  the reset mail carries a code instead of a link. The
    |                   broker's token is untouched underneath — the code's row
    |                   carries it — so expiry and single use stay Laravel's.
    |
    | Everything is off until it is switched on: an installation that says
    | nothing here gets no new routes and no new mail.
    |
    | Who gets the mailed second factor is the user model's answer first: a model
    | implementing `Contracts\ReceivesLoginCodes` decides per user, and one that
    | does not leaves the switch below answering for everybody without a
    | confirmed authenticator app.
